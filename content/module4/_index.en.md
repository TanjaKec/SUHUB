### Module 4

## Statistical Modelling II

#### Machine learning: Multifactor linear regression and classification modelling

##### You will be introduced to broad ideas of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, as well as a number of core machine learning concepts. In this module, regression modelling is the key modelling construct that will be first introduced and then developed. You will learn the importance of selecting an appropriate causal model depending upon particular circumstances. You will also become familiar with the fundamental models and algorithms used in classification. With the knowledge from this lesson you will not just be able to conduct regression analysis, and interpret and report its outcomes in an appropriate manner, but you will be able to implement key learning algorithms for uncovering patterns and structure within data. 

#### What you will learn:

* Multifactor linear regression modelling:
  -	fitting a linear model
  -	validating model: the coefficient of determination
  -	interpretation of the parameters and reporting of the nature of the relationships
*	Classification modelling
*	Assessment of the efficacy of the fitted models using a rigorous training and testing framework
